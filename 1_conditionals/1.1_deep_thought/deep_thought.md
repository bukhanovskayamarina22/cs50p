# Deep Thought - CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python

> ## Excerpt
> An introduction to programming using Python, a popular language for general-purpose programming, data science, web programming, and more.

“All right,” said the computer, and settled into silence again. The two men fidgeted. The tension was unbearable.  
“You’re really not going to like it,” observed Deep Thought.  
“Tell us!”  
“All right,” said Deep Thought. “The Answer to the Great Question…”  
“Yes…!”  
“Of Life, the Universe and Everything…” said Deep Thought.  
“Yes…!”  
“Is…” said Deep Thought, and paused.  
“Yes…!”  
“Is…”  
“Yes…!!!…?”  
“Forty-two,” said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm.”

— _The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy_, Douglas Adams

In `deep.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for the answer to the Great Question of Life, the Universe and Everything, outputting `Yes` if the user inputs `42` or (case-insensitively) `forty-two` or `forty two`. Otherwise output `No`.

Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/), click on your terminal window, and execute `cd` by itself. You should find that your terminal window’s prompt resembles the below:

to make a folder called `deep` in your codespace.

to change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal prompt as `deep/ $`. You can now execute

to make a file called `deep.py` where you’ll write your program.

Be sure to vary the casing of your input and “accidentally” add spaces on either side of your input before pressing enter. Your program should behave as expected, case- and space-insensitively.

You can execute the below to check your code using `check50`, a program that CS50 will use to test your code when you submit. But be sure to test it yourself as well!

```
check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/deep
```

Green smilies mean your program has passed a test! Red frownies will indicate your program output something unexpected. Visit the URL that `check50` outputs to see the input `check50` handed to your program, what output it expected, and what output your program actually gave.

In your terminal, execute the below to submit your work.

```
submit50 cs50/problems/2022/python/deep
```
