# Coke Machine - CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python

> ## Excerpt
> An introduction to programming using Python, a popular language for general-purpose programming, data science, web programming, and more.

Suppose that a machine sells bottles of Coca-Cola (Coke) for 50 cents and only accepts coins in these denominations: 25 cents, 10 cents, and 5 cents.

In a file called `coke.py`, implement a program that prompts the user to insert a coin, one at a time, each time informing the user of the amount due. Once the user has inputted at least 50 cents, output how many cents in change the user is owed. Assume that the user will only input integers, and ignore any integer that isn’t an accepted denomination.

Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/), click on your terminal window, and execute `cd` by itself. You should find that your terminal window’s prompt resembles the below:

to make a folder called `coke` in your codespace.

to change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal prompt as `coke/ $`. You can now execute

to make a file called `coke.py` where you’ll write your program.

You can execute the below to check your code using `check50`, a program that CS50 will use to test your code when you submit. But be sure to test it yourself as well!

```

```

Green smilies mean your program has passed a test! Red frownies will indicate your program output something unexpected. Visit the URL that `check50` outputs to see the input `check50` handed to your program, what output it expected, and what output your program actually gave.

In your terminal, execute the below to submit your work.

```

```
