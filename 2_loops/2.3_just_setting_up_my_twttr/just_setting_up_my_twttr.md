When texting or tweeting, it’s not uncommon to shorten words to save time or space, as by omitting vowels, much like Twitter was originally called _twttr_. In a file called `twttr.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for a `str` of text and then outputs that same text but with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted, whether inputted in uppercase or lowercase.

Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/), click on your terminal window, and execute `cd` by itself. You should find that your terminal window’s prompt resembles the below:

to make a folder called `twttr` in your codespace.

to change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal prompt as `twttr/ $`. You can now execute

to make a file called `twttr.py` where you’ll write your program.

You can execute the below to check your code using `check50`, a program that CS50 will use to test your code when you submit. But be sure to test it yourself as well!

```
check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/twttr
```

Green smilies mean your program has passed a test! Red frownies will indicate your program output something unexpected. Visit the URL that `check50` outputs to see the input `check50` handed to your program, what output it expected, and what output your program actually gave.

In your terminal, execute the below to submit your work.

```
submit50 cs50/problems/2022/python/twttr
```
