Before there were emoji, there were [emoticons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_emoticons), whereby text like `:)` was a happy face and text like `:(` was a sad face. Nowadays, programs tend to convert emoticons to emoji automatically!

In a file called `faces.py`, implement a function called `convert` that accepts a `str` as input and returns that same input with any `:)` converted to üôÇ (otherwise known as a [slightly smiling face](https://emojipedia.org/slightly-smiling-face/)) and any `:(` converted to üôÅ (otherwise known as a [slightly frowning face](https://emojipedia.org/slightly-frowning-face/)). All other text should be returned unchanged.

Then, in that same file, implement a function called `main` that prompts the user for input, calls `convert` on that input, and prints the result. You‚Äôre welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing a `str` of your own as an argument to `input`. Be sure to call `main` at the bottom of your file.

Execute `cd` by itself in your terminal window. You should find that your terminal window‚Äôs prompt resembles the below:

to make a folder called `faces` in your codespace.

to change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal prompt as `faces/ $`. You can now execute

to make a file called `faces.py` where you‚Äôll write your program.

You can execute the below to check your code using `check50`, a program that CS50 will use to test your code when you submit. But be sure to test it yourself as well!

```

```

Green smilies mean your program has passed a test! Red frownies will indicate your program output something unexpected. Visit the URL that `check50` outputs to see the input `check50` handed to your program, what output it expected, and what output your program actually gave.

In your terminal, execute the below to submit your work.

```
