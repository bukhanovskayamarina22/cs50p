# Indoor Voice - CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python

> ## Excerpt
> An introduction to programming using Python, a popular language for general-purpose programming, data science, web programming, and more.

WRITING IN ALL CAPS IS LIKE YELLING.

Best to use your “indoor voice” sometimes, writing entirely in lowercase.

In a file called `indoor.py`, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged. You’re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing a `str` of your own as an argument to `input`.

Execute `cd` by itself in your terminal window. You should find that your terminal window’s prompt resembles the below:

to make a folder called `indoor` in your codespace.

to change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal prompt as `indoor/ $`. You can now execute

to make a file called `indoor.py` where you’ll write your program.

Here’s how to test your code manually. At the `indoor/ $` prompt in your terminal: :

If you run into an error saying your file cannot be opened, retrace your steps to be sure that you are inside your `indoor` folder and have saved your `indoor.py` file there. Remember how?

You can execute the below to check your code using `check50`, a program that CS50 will use to test your code when you submit. But be sure to test it yourself as well!

```
check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/indoor
```

Green smilies mean your program has passed a test! Red frownies will indicate your program output something unexpected. Visit the URL that `check50` outputs to see the input `check50` handed to your program, what output it expected, and what output your program actually gave.

In your terminal, execute the below to submit your work.

```
submit50 cs50/problems/2022/python/indoor
```
